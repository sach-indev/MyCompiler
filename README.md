# My Programming Language Project

Hello, Sachin here

This is a small project where I'm experimenting with **making my own programming language** using another programming language.  

Right now, it’s not the most polished or nicest thing to see, but it’s a work in progress. I’m following [Pixeled on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@pixeled-yt) to guide me through the basics of building this project.  

Over time, I’ll try to make it look more like the language I actually want.  

That’s all for now — let’s see how this goes
