# My Programming Language Project

Hello, Sachin here ðŸ‘‹  

This is a small project where I'm experimenting with **making my own programming language** using another programming language.  

Right now, itâ€™s not the most polished or nicest thing to see ðŸ˜…, but itâ€™s a work in progress. Iâ€™m following [Pixelated on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@PixelatedApollo) to guide me through the basics of building this project.  

Over time, Iâ€™ll try to make it look more like the language I actually want.  

Thatâ€™s all for now â€” letâ€™s see how this goes ðŸš€
